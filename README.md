## Gameplay

Your mission as a **Space Cadet** is to skillfully maneuver your spaceship and obliterate hostile alien invaders and obstacles while amassing points. Here's a brief guide on how to play:

- **Controls**: Utilize the *left* and *right* arrow keys to navigate the spaceship. Press the *space* bar to unleash powerful shots.

  - `Alien1`: Advances towards your spaceship, firing projectiles to bring you down.
  - `Alien2`: Takes a diagonal trajectory across the screen, adjusting direction when reaching screen edges.
  - `Alien3`: Moves horizontally and switches movement direction periodically.

- **Avoid Obstacles**: Sidestep or obliterate incoming obstacles, symbolized by `Rock` objects.
